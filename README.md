🚖 Taxi Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project explores taxi trip data using Python and popular data analysis libraries. The goal is to uncover insights into ride patterns, customer behavior, and operational efficiency through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python for data processing

Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib for static visualizations

Seaborn for advanced statistical plots

📊 Key Analysis
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing datasets.

Trip Distribution: Analyzing ride counts by time of day, day of week, and month.

Fare Analysis: Studying fare amounts, distance vs. fare relationships, and outliers.

Passenger Trends: Exploring passenger counts and ride frequency.

Geospatial Insights: Identifying pickup and drop‑off hotspots (if location data available).

📈 Visualizations
Histograms and bar charts for trip counts

Line plots for time‑series trends

Scatter plots for distance vs. fare

Heatmaps for correlation analysis

🎯 Outcomes
This analysis provides a clear picture of taxi operations, helping to identify:

Peak demand hours

Pricing anomalies

Passenger behavior trends

Operational inefficiencies
